# Fake-News-Detection

1) We have created a script 
	pipeline.sh  
		//run ==> chmod +x pipeline.sh 
		//for running as a script
   which will automatically run all python code.

2) Since we are demonstrating using two approaches, namely Stance and Satire, the code is included in two different folders.

3) We have also included approach specific README files in respective folders.

4) Download the dataset for satire at: https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tbaldwin/resources/satire/
   Once downloaded - 
   	a. Unzip this folder
   	b. Put the unzipped 'satire' folder under 'resources' folder
   	c. Put this resources folder at the same level as main.py in main 'satire' folder.

 5) Download the dataset for stance at: https://github.com/FakeNewsChallenge/fnc-1
 	Once downloaded - 
 	a. Put the unzipped folder in FNC-Project-Stance directory
